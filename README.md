## 🤯 What Is This?
**`codexapp`** is a lightweight bridge that gives you a browser-accessible UI for Codex app-server workflows.

You run one command. It starts a local web server. You open it from your machine, your LAN, or wherever your setup allows.  

**TL;DR 🧠: Codex app UI, unlocked for Linux, Windows, and Termux-powered Android setups.**

---

## ⚡ Quick Start
> **The main event.**

```bash
# 🔓 Run instantly (recommended)
npx codexapp

# 🌐 Then open in browser
# http://localhost:5900
```

By default, `codexapp` starts without a tunnel. Enable it explicitly with `npx codexapp --tunnel`.
Use `--no-password` to disable web UI authentication and password file generation:

```bash
npx codexapp --no-password
```

The default bind address is `0.0.0.0`; with `--no-password`, anyone who can reach the server can use it.
The sandbox mode is inherited from Codex configuration unless `--sandbox-mode` or `CODEXUI_SANDBOX_MODE` is set.
Supported modes are `read-only`, `workspace-write`, and `danger-full-access`; the CLI option takes precedence.

If you are using a provider or AI gateway that is already authenticated and do not want `codexapp` to force `codex login` during startup, use:

```bash
npx codexapp --no-login
```

### Linux 🐧
```bash
node -v   # should be 18+
npx codexapp
```

### Windows 🪟 (PowerShell)
```powershell
node -v   # 18+
npx codexapp
```

### Termux (Android) 🤖
```bash
pkg update && pkg upgrade -y
pkg install nodejs -y
npx codexapp
```

Android background requirements:

1. Keep `codexapp` running in the current Termux session (do not close it).
2. In Android settings, disable battery optimization for `Termux`.
3. Keep the persistent Termux notification enabled so Android is less likely to kill it.
4. Optional but recommended in Termux:
```bash
termux-wake-lock
```
5. Open the shown URL in your Android browser. If the app is killed, return to Termux and run `npx codexapp` again.

## iPhone / iPad via Tailscale Serve

If you want to use codexUI from iPhone or iPad Safari, serving it over HTTPS is recommended.

A practical private setup is to run codexUI locally and publish it inside your tailnet with Tailscale Serve:

```powershell
npx codexapp --no-tunnel --port 5900
tailscale serve --bg 5900
```

Then open:

```text
https://<your-machine>.<your-tailnet>.ts.net
```

This setup worked well in practice for:

- iPhone Safari access
- Add to Home Screen
- the built-in dictation / transcription feature in the app
- viewing the same projects and conversations from the Windows host

Notes:

- Tailscale Serve keeps access private to your tailnet
- on iOS, HTTPS / secure context appears to be important for mobile browser access and dictation
- some minor mobile Safari CSS issues may still exist, but they do not prevent normal use
- depending on proxying details, authentication behavior may differ from direct remote access
- if conversations created in the web UI do not immediately appear in the Windows app, restarting the Windows app may refresh them

## ✨ Features
> **The payload.**

- 🚀 One-command launch with `npx codexapp`
- 🌍 Cross-platform support for Linux, Windows, and Termux on Android
- 🖥️ Browser-first Codex UI flow on `http://localhost:5900`
- 🌐 LAN-friendly access from other devices on the same network
- 🧪 Remote/headless-friendly setup for server-based Codex usage
- 🔌 Works with reverse proxies and tunneling setups
- ⚡ No global install required for quick experimentation
- 🎙️ Built-in hold-to-dictate voice input with transcription to composer draft
- 🤖 Optional Telegram bot bridge: send messages to bot, forward into mapped thread, send assistant reply back to Telegram
- 💾 Project portability: export a project as a ZIP from project or thread menus, including matching Codex chat JSONL history under `.codex-project/chats/`
- 📦 Project import: restore exported project ZIPs from the browser via `Import Project`
- 🔁 Imported chats are rewritten for the destination `CODEX_HOME`, project path, and currently selected provider/model so they can be resumed in the new environment
- ⚙️ Project ZIP performance: exports stream ZIP bytes with response backpressure handling and skip generated/git-ignored folders; imports still buffer the selected ZIP once because the browser upload arrives as a single file

### Telegram Bot Bridge (Optional)

Set these environment variables before starting `codexapp`:

```bash
export TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="<your-telegram-bot-token>"
export TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USER_IDS="<your-telegram-user-id>,<optional-second-id>"
export TELEGRAM_DEFAULT_CWD="$PWD" # optional, defaults to current working directory
npx codexapp
```

`TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USER_IDS` is required for safe access. Only allowlisted Telegram user IDs can use the bridge. If no allowed user IDs are configured, incoming Telegram messages are rejected.

To find your Telegram user ID:

1. Send a message to your bot.
2. Run `curl "https://api.telegram.org/bot<your-telegram-bot-token>/getUpdates"`.
3. Read `message.from.id` from the returned update payload.

Bot commands:

- `/start` show quick help and thread picker
- `/threads` list recent threads and pick one
- `/newthread` create and map a new Codex thread for this Telegram chat
- `/thread <threadId>` map current Telegram chat to an existing thread
- `/current` show currently connected thread for this chat
- `/history` show recent history for current thread
- `/status` show bridge/mapping status
- `/whoami` show your Telegram user/chat IDs and authorization state
- `/help` show command reference

Outgoing assistant messages are sent with Telegram `parse_mode=HTML` for formatting, with automatic plain-text fallback if HTML delivery fails.

## Run a built local checkout

This repository keeps Vue/TypeScript sources. Build them before launching a local package snapshot:

Use Node.js 22 and pnpm 12.16.1 for source development and CI. The
`packageManager` field pins pnpm; install it with `npm install -g pnpm@12.16.1`
if it is not already available. This development toolchain does not change the
published CLI's Node.js runtime requirement.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run build
npm start -- --no-tunnel --port 5900
```

Commit dependency changes together with `pnpm-lock.yaml`; CI installs with
`pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`. Dependency lifecycle approvals live in
`pnpm-workspace.yaml`: `esbuild` sets up its platform binary, and `node-pty`
selects prebuilt native bindings or compiles them (requiring Python, make, and a
C++ compiler on Linux when no prebuild is available). `protobufjs` and
`@firebase/util` are absent from the current dependency graph and have no standing
build approval. Newly introduced lifecycle scripts must be reviewed and recorded
in the workspace configuration; fresh installs of the committed graph need no
manual approval.

Repeat the build after changing sources or pulling updates. `npm start` packs the built checkout into npm's cache and launches a tarball named by its SHA-256 hash. Unchanged package contents reuse the snapshot; changed contents get a new package path, avoiding stale directory-based `npx --package=...` installs. The launcher prints the checkout path and package revision. Stop the previous server and reload the browser after restarting. Dependencies are installed by npm on the first snapshot launch.

Installation no longer runs a native PTY repair hook automatically. If a terminal cannot load its optional native binding, run `npm run repair:pty`.

`pnpm run build` produces minified, content-hashed Vite assets in `dist/` and versions the service worker cache from the complete frontend contents. HTTP entry points require revalidation. Edit `src/`, then rebuild; generated bundles are not source files in this repository.

Reasoning effort choices follow each model's `supportedReasoningEfforts` in server order. Unsupported selections fall back to the model's supported default or its first supported value. Missing capabilities show a disabled “Model default” selector and omit an explicit effort. Capabilities are scoped to the provider, including direct and queued turns.

Type `/` in the composer to choose a skill, `/plan`, or `/goal`. Goal mode prefixes the submitted prompt with `/goal`. Existing thread goals can be edited, paused, or cleared in the goal panel. The server must support `thread/goal/get`, `thread/goal/set`, and `thread/goal/clear`.
